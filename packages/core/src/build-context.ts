/**
 * Assemble a Context from the parts a surface already has. This removes the per-surface Context boilerplate:
 * each surface authenticates (producing an `actor` + `scopes`) and reads the request's confirmation /
 * idempotency fields, then hands them here rather than hand-rolling a Context object and a `requireScope`
 * closure of its own.
 *
 * The returned Context's `requireScope(scope)` throws `ScopeError` unless `scopes` includes that scope or
 * the wildcard `"*"`, and `audit` defaults to a no-op. This is the exact scope/audit policy the `logs`
 * example host hand-wrote, generalized into core so every surface shares one implementation.
 *
 * CARVE NOTE: this helper takes only spine-free parts. There is no tenant, no install, no db and no appId in
 * the options — a multi-tenant host folds its tenant into `scopes` and the `idempotencyKey` BEFORE calling
 * this, exactly as the carve requires. The framework never learns what a tenant is.
